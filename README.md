### :orange_book: Experimenting with Swift on Sundays

This is an initiative taken to practice and enchance Swift skills, creating apps for Apple Platforms ie: iOS, watchOS and macOS.

Some of the Projects are inspired and based on HackingWithSwift's SwiftOnSunday Series and some of them would be my own created.

- Some Projects would be Games.
- Some Projects would be Apps.
- There would be even playgrounds/code snippets
