### :orange_book: Experimenting with Swift on Sundays

This is an initiative taken to practice and enchance Swift skills, creating apps for Apple Platforms ie: iOS, watchOS and macOS.

Some of the Projects are based on HackingWithSwift's SwiftOnSunday Series and some of them would be my own created.

- Some Projects would be Games.
- Some Projects would be Apps.
- There would be even playgrounds/code snippets

### :page_facing_up:Projects

- WatchOS Project - [WatchReactions](https://github.com/BuckyBoy6399/SundaySwift/blob/master/WatchReactions/WatchReactions.md) - Basic - (WatchKit, AVFoundation)

:sparkles: **Happy Coding with Swift!**
