# SundaySwift

**Experimenting with Swift on Sundays**

This is an initiative taken to practice and enchance Swift skills, creating apps for Apple Platforms ie: iOS, watchOS and macOS.

Some of the Projects are based on HackingWithSwift's SwiftOnSunday Series and some of them would be my own created.

Some Projects would be Games.
Some Projects would be Apps.
There would be even playgrounds/code snippets

### Projects

- WatchOS Project - WatchReactions - Basic - (WatchKit, AVFoundation)

**Happy Coding with Swift**
