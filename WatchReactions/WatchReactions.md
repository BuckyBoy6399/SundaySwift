# Sunday Swift - Project One - WatchOS

### Soundboard App for WatchOS

This is a basic WatchOS app lets you hear voice recordings, record your own voice and play it.

Concepts I learnt about:

- WatchKit Basics
- AVFoundation

If you work on iOS, then this is how you can relate it:

ie: on iOS it is -> on WatchOS it is

- ViewController -> InterfaceController
- UIKit -> WatchKit
- AutoLayout -> Manages automatically
