# Sunday Swift - Project Three - Text Transformer

![TextTransformer](https://github.com/rajhraval1/SundaySwift/blob/master/TextTransformer/texttransformer.gif)

### TextTransformer for learning macOS App Development

This is a simple macOS Menu Bar app that converts text into a unique text based on the selected segments (ROT13 algorithm, Zalgo Text, Similar Text and Strikethrough Text) and copy it.

Concepts I learnt about:

- Cocoa (Apple's Native API for macOS Development) Basics
- Unicodes
- macOS UI Elements

If you work on iOS, then this is how you can relate it:

ie: on iOS it is -> on macOS it is

- UIKit -> Cocoa
- UITextField -> NSTextField
