### Clocky for learning macOS App Development

It is a simple status bar application that shows time, handling preferences like showing Dock Icon, showing flashing separators and disabling to show seconds in time.

Concepts I learnt about:

- Working broadly on Extensions
- macOS Basics
- Working on the AppDelegate
- NSMenuItems
- NSStatusBar
- NSStatusItem
