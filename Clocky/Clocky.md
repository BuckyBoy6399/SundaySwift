### Clocky for learning macOS App Development

It is a simple status bar application that shows time, handling preferences like showing Dock Icon, showing flashing separators and disabling to show seconds in time.

Concepts I learnt about:

Part 1 - Creating the Menu for the App and adding the Clock Timer

- Working broadly on Extensions
- macOS Basics
- Working on the AppDelegate
- NSMenuItems
- NSStatusBar
- NSStatusItem

Part 2 - Adding Reminders, so users can set reminders and get notified
